# MS-AntiSpy
Here is a small project I worked on for a client (It's been a few years) who, unfortunately‚Äîor maybe fortunately‚Äîswitched to Linux. Now, I can release it publicly. I looked at it and tweaked a few business features for private users, some of which even come from Winpilot. Other than that, this program has nothing in common with my other small apps under the hood, as it was designed with a focus on durability and longevity.

The original and my fork were initially written in C++. For the relaunch, I've rewritten it in C#. The app looks exactly like the original and does the same thing, but now it's for Windows 11. It was and is a relaunch of the [legendary little helper, XP-Antispy](https://xp-antispy.org/en/), which was indispensable under Windows XP. Does anyone know what happened to the developer Chris from back then? XP was my first OS and I wasn't even a coder back then. I didn't see the magic behind it at the time. Nevertheless, I used the tool. Thanks to you, Chris, wherever you are.

The "XP" in the name has now become a smiley "MS", which stands for eXtreme Defense, though it also carries the playful connotation of the üòÜ smiley. The app continues the versioning from where the original left off, at version 3.98. If you're interested, feel free to try and share it, and I'll be ready to release the code soon.

# Improvements over the original
- Full support for Windows 11
- Partial support for Windows 10 (many, but not all tweaks are suitable for W10)
- 64-bit
- DPI support
- Plugin support (without programming knowledge, the MS-Antispy functionality can be extended via batch/Powershell code in the form of .JSON files)
- XP-Antispy was originally written in C++. To make it less complex, I rewrote it in C#, which is more Windows-focused. However, C# itself is written in C++ ;)
